# They're Making Decoys

**Challenge Text:**

The Sergeant from Clarence asked one of the Corporals to patrol for Emus to keep the our fresh troops on their toes and maybe scare some discipline into them. They headed out to an area with lots of sightings reported though they never made it back. Some of the last images uploaded showed what looked to be the enemy, though it turned out to be decoys. These broom heads are getting clever. I'm guessing we're not getting the camera equipment back...

Find the location (latitude, longitude) of this area rounded to 4 decimal places and wrap it in DUCTF{}, e.g. DUCTF{-25.3445,131.0354}

Originally, the start of the challenge was going to have: Sergeant Clarence asked one of the Corporals to patrol for Emus...

...so it could have been worse!

There's a few ways to solve this one, though as for any OSINT challenge in another country, pro tip is to exit out of that country so that Google search results are more location specific (or at the very least, match what the Author was seeing when testing the challenge).

Possible Solve methods:

1. If you Googled "Clarence Emu Sightings" or similar, one of the top results might be the Coastal Emu Sightings Map from Clarence Conversations (https://www.clarenceconversations.com.au/coastalemus/maps/coastal-emu-sightings-map). If you go to this map, you see a satellite map where you can drill down on sightings. If you follow the most sightings at each level, you get to approximately the location. Brooms Head Road should appear, hopefully reminding you of the challenge text "broom heads". There will be a bit of Google Street View with this method, enjoy your travels. Hopefully you see the sign "The Emus" that halts your travels and then you see Decoys. Nearest cross street is Tailem Dr, obviously, as you're tailing Emus.


2. If you Google Image search (from Australia, remember VPN advice) the following, without the quotes "emu metal sculpture tree grass roadside", you see a whole bunch though one on page 2 (ish) looks REALLY familiar. "Friends  of Brooms Head" on Facebook gives you the rough location and again, Broom Head / Brooms Head should be a hint you are on the right path.


3. Researching Clarence the location and finding https://www.clarence.nsw.gov.au/ - searching the site or using the search you will hopefully stumble upon information about Emus. If you search for "Emu" it will short cut you finding information about the Coastal Emu Sightings Map, same as possible options 1.


I hope you enjoyed the journey!
