The Sergeant from Clarence asked one of the Corporals to patrol for Emus to keep the our fresh troops on their toes and maybe scare some discipline into them. They headed out to an area with lots of sightings reported though they never made it back. Some of the last images uploaded showed what looked to be the enemy, though it turned out to be decoys. These broom heads are getting clever. I'm guessing we're not getting the camera equipment back...

Find the location (lattitude, longitude) of this area rounded to 4 decimal places and wrap it in `DUCTF{}`, e.g. `DUCTF{-25.3445,131.0354}`
