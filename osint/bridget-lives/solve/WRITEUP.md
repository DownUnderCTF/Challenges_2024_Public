# Bridget Lives

**Challenge Text**: After dropping numerous 0days last year Bridget has flown the coop. This is the last picture she posted before going dark. Where was this photo taken from?

NOTE: Flag is case-insensitive and requires placing inside DUCTF{}! e.g. DUCTF{name_of_building}

This is a basic Google Lens or Google Images challenge. Uploading this image to Google Images, for example, you should see a bunch of results though the bridge supports are quite unique, leading you to the Robertson Bridge in Singapore. The challenge asked for where the the photo was taken from, with the name_of_building as the flag. In this case, it's the Four Points by Sheraton. It really helps using Google Street view and standing on the bridge and looking up, roughtly matching the angles. Photo taken near the top and from the left window where the lifts are in the building.
