We are given a photo with the description:
That looks like a pretty cool place to escape by boat, EXAMINE the image and discover the name of this structure. 

Instantly attention is drawn to the word EXAMINE as its in capitals, I decided to look at the files EXIF data to see if i could gleam any information from that.

There is multiple ways to view EXIF data but I decided to open up the image in Microsoft Photos.

To view file information(EXIF data) in Microsoft Photos, press ALT+Enter to bring up the Info Menu.

Upon opening the info pane, I was greeted with a bing maps pane with a description of "Olivers Hill Boat Ramp"

Following the flag syntax instructions, we end up with the FLAG:
DUCTF{Olivers_Hill_Boat_Ramp}
