[Ramble before song]

[Verse 1]

Council of hackers let's act for our boi
time to employ and deploy the fat monke to destroy
The cage George is locked in from infant to old age
this sage enraged monke ready to engage

But first, let me give ya'll my resume
All the reasons why I am the one to fulfil this destiny
In infancy I plead I was definitely a script kiddie
Buying a fake tool like a fool and losing my three fiddy

My CPU and GPU used to heat up quick
as I Googled to find any bug bounty tip
the point and click game was the aim for my brain
But I installed a miner that caused my laptop to drain

"Lol try harder" some hacker said with laughter
These words of slander reflected that I was a disaster
Smarter I needed to get and to become a hacking master
So I registered into DownUnder and entered as a challenger

[Chorus]

Going back to the Jungle with this one
Curious George did nothing wrong
Going back to the Jungle with this one
The yellow hat man is a snitch and his ass should run

[Verse 2]

Highstrung I begun in the DownUnder competition
Repetition to denial then eventually admission
My confession I could not make a single flag submission
But my ambition prevented me to stop at this position

But fruition was achieved once I tried an OSINT task
It asked for me to find and search for data to unmask
I started smacking, whacking and clickclacking my keyboard
And oh lord on a forum board I got a flag reward

Yeeeeah that's right I am now the leet
Please bow peasants to me if you want to speak
Among the hacking vets I am the average primate threat
Upset me and you will never forget the feeling of regret

Now we finally get back to this day
that's my curriculum vitae and I am the perfect monke
To find a way to release George from his prison stay
And I promise we will be back into the jungle by Monday
