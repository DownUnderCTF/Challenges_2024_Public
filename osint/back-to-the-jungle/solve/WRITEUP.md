back to the jungle write up
============

MC Fat Monke was a character from DownUnderCTF 2023 that has returned this year! Checking their soundcloud, they have released a new song called Back to the Jungle. In the description for the song they had a link to a music video on YouTube (https://youtu.be/jmhn3IMLQyM).

Watching the music video, these lines gave a massive hint of where the flag was:

> But fruition was achieved once I tried an OSINT task
> It asked for me to find and search for data to unmask
> I started smacking, whacking and clickclacking my keyboard
> And oh lord on a forum board I got a flag reward

On the last line, a screenshot of some webpage with a flag was displayed on a laptop screen, the URL for the page was included in the screenshot (https://youtu.be/jmhn3IMLQyM?si=i3URhQ55gSHeAFjJ&t=154). Visiting the site (https://average-primate-th.wixsite.com/mc-fat-monke-appreci) and scrolling down will show the flag.
