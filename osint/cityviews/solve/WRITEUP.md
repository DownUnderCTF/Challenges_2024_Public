============
I had a look at what was in the image and saw a billboard with an ad for 3AW Melbourne and that the building opposite WHERE it was taken from had the text E G SO*THERN H. I figured the word was southern and the h word was hotel so I googled "Southern Hotel Melbourne" and stumbled across `The Great Southern Hotel. A quick look on street view (https://www.google.com/maps/@-37.820071,144.9548188,3a,75y,21.5h,106.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1so0lXm2PL6Ox9ocBrRN66wA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?) confirmed the building was indeed the one pictured. I then focused my attention on the building opposite since based on the camera angle this had to be where it was taken from. From streetview imagery, it appears to be an Holiday Inn but when I clicked on it to investigate I was greeted with: Hotel Indigo Melbourne.

The flag thus is: DUCTF{Hotel_Indigo_Melbourne}
