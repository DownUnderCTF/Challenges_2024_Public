  The big bad bot got a bit lonely after a hard day of work and made a Web Artificial Intelligence Firewall Utiliy (WAIFU) to talk with and block hacking attempts.

  *Can you bypass the bot's WAIFU?*

  **Important Note**

  - Use `127.0.0.1` (not localhost) instead of container names (the ports the services are listening on are the same).
