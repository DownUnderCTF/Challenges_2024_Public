Players are provided with a binary file called `message.bin`.

The file contains a ternary encoding of a brainfuck program where every 2 digits corresponds to a brainfuck instruction.

Ternary encoding means instead of a base2 system like binary it's a base3 system. Each digit can be 0, 1, or 2

The flag is output by executing the brainfuck program.
