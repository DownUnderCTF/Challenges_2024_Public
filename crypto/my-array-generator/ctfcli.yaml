  The MAG cipher was a fast stream cipher algorithm submitted to the eSTREAM
  project of the eCRYPT network. It was not selected for consideration in the
  second phase, as further cryptanalysis revealed a number of vulnerabilities
  including a distinguisher, partial-key recovery and in some variants a full
  key recovery. This challenge implements a weaker version of the MAG cipher
  with some security features removed.

  Funnily enough, the wikipedia article got deleted just as I was writing this
  challenge due to a lack of notability.
