Looks like one of our Emu soldiers ran something on an Outpost machine and now it's doing strange things.
We took a memory dump as a precaution. Can you tell us whats going on?

This challenge has four parts to combine into the final flag with `_` between each answer.
Find all four answers and combine them into the flag as all lower case like `DUCTF{answer1_answer2_answer3_answer4}`
eg. `DUCTF{malicious.xlsm_invoke-mimikatz_malware.exe-malware2.exe_strong-password123}`

1. What was the name of the malicious executable? eg `malicious.xlsm`
2. What was the name of the powershell module used? eg `invoke-mimikatz`
3. What were the names of the two files executed from the malicious executable (In alphabetical order with - in between and no spaces)? eg `malware.exe-malware2.exe`
4. What was the password of the new account created through powershell? eg `strong-password123`
